spring-boot-web-app
===================

web application based on spring boot with basic CRUD operation as create new credit card, edit credit card, show and delete credit card. 
I used apache tiles for jsp templating. 
Configuration is without xml (web.xml, context.xml, etc.)

How to run it?

git clone this project

cd spring-boot-web-app

mvn clean package

and java sk.mirorucka.spring.Launcher 

you can see some test in sk.mirorucka.ServiceTest in TestNG framework
